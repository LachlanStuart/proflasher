        The word/phrase.
        For reflexive verbs, use the first or second person so that the case is clear, e.g. "ich stelle mir vor"/"I imagine" (the English should match the German).
        If a verb is typically used with a preposition, include it, and add a simple object so that the case is clear, e.g. "Ich erinnere mich an diesen Baum."/"I remember that tree." (prefer a masculine object with a definite article so that the case is obvious).
        For other verbs, use the infinitive form of the verb e.g. "können"/"to be able to" (remember the "to" prefix in English)
        For nouns, the dictionary form should also include their nominative case article, and use shorthand to indicate the plural form in parentheses, e.g. "der Strand (-¨e)".
        When there are multiple English translations for the word/phrase, use a comma to separate them, but keep the list minimal.
        Avoid providing more than 3 English translations for a word.
      Sentence1: First example sentence showing usage
