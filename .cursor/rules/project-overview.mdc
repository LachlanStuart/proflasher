# Proflasher Project Overview

This is a personal open-source flashcard generation project focused on simplicity rather than robustness or configurability.

The project is a Next.js web application that:
1. Generates flashcards by providing tools to Google Gemini models (via OpenAI API) and asking them to generate drafts of cards
2. Allows customizing the cards before they're saved to Anki
3. Allows asking Gemini to do bulk queries and rewriting cards
4. Supports multiple languages, each with its own field structure and card styles, defined in [noteTemplates.ts](mdc:proflasher/web_ui/src/lib/cardModel/noteTemplates.ts)

## Key Design Principles
- Minimalist code with direct function calls rather than services/classes
- No extensive error handling - allows errors to propagate
- Configuration is minimal, with simple environment variables used directly
- Files are structured based on Next.js conventions
