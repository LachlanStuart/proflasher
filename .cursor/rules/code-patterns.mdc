# Code Patterns and Design Principles

## Simplicity First
- Stateless functions are preferred over classes/services
- Avoid try/catch blocks when possible
- Let errors propagate naturally - they give better stack traces
- Don't add default values - it's simpler if everything needed is always provided
- Don't add configuration - just put inline values

## API Pattern
- Direct access to filesystem using node:fs/promises
- Access environment variables with e.g. `import { env } from "~/env";` and `env.DATA_REPO_PATH`

## Type Safety
- Use explicit TypeScript types but keep them minimal
- Avoid optional properties
- Don't preemptively add properties
