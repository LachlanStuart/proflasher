# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/lib/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar"

# Path to the root of your data repository
DATA_REPO_PATH=../data

# URL for AnkiConnect (default is usually fine)
ANKICONNECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765

# LLM Configuration
# This uses the OpenAI client library for flexibility, but Google Gemini is suggested.
# The openai client library when used with Gemini typically uses environment variables like
# GOOGLE_API_KEY or specific configuration in the client initialization.
